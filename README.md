# NLP Analysis of Disneyland Reviews

## Project Overview
This project involves performing a comprehensive Natural Language Processing (NLP) analysis on a dataset of Disneyland reviews. The objective is to preprocess the text data, vectorize it, and perform topic modeling to extract insights from the reviews.

## Setting Up
1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repo-url>`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd NLP-Disneyland-Reviews`
3. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   - Windows: `python -m venv venv && .\venv\Scripts\activate`
   - macOS/Linux: `python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate`
4. Install the dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Running the Analysis
1. Run the preprocessing script: `python scripts/preprocess.py`
2. Perform text vectorization: `python scripts/vectorize.py`
3. Conduct topic modeling: `python scripts/topic_model.py`

## Results
The results of the analysis including figures and topic summaries are located in the `results/` directory.
